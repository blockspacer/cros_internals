      <description>Recently, WS was replaced with WS2:
 window-service: removes mus_demo, test_wm, and some unnecessary deps Issue 865689 Remove window-service  I&amp;rsquo;ve run mus_demo to test ozone-gbm, but now it&amp;rsquo;s gone. :-( So, I need to figure it out what is the difference between WS1 and WS2.

There is a Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9mrR2tqVbQ
Here is the readme about CrOSVM:</description>
